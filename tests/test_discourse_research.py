"""Smoke tests for scripts/discourse_research.py.

Covers:
1. Happy path: a small set of multi-platform results produces a brief with
   themes, source breakdown, and inline-link citations.
2. Empty input: zero results does not crash and emits a brief noting
   insufficient coverage.
3. LAW hygiene: output contains no em-dashes (LAW 3) and no fabricated titles
   that differ from the input data (LAW 2).

Stdlib + pytest only. No network. Subprocess invocation matches the
documented CLI.
